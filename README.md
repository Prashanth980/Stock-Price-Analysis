# Stock-Price-Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the Stock Price Analysis! This repository contains the code and analysis for my data analysis project. The project involves analyzing historical stock price data, visualizing trends, and developing a forecasting model using Python and data science techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`Stock_price_analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire data analysis process, including data loading, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and stock price correlation.
- **`data/`**: Directory containing the stock price data used in the project.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the analysis, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, glob, etc.)
